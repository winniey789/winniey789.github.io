        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to incorporate it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and ice water, then mix until the dough comes together. You may need to add a little more water if the dough is too dry. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Once chilled, roll the dough out on a floured surface to fit a 9-inch tart pan. Press the dough into the pan and trim any excess. Use a fork to prick the bottom of the crust to prevent it from puffing up during baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-bake the Crust:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil over the crust, and fill it with pie weights or dried beans to prevent it from rising. Bake for 10-12 minutes, then remove the weights and paper. Continue baking for another 5-7 minutes until the crust is golden and fully cooked. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Blueberry Filling:</strong> In a medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of the blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it begins to thicken and bubble (about 5-7 minutes). Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries for texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Tart:</strong> Once the crust has cooled, pour the blueberry filling into the tart shell, spreading it evenly. Allow the tart to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours to set the filling.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Glaze (Optional):</strong> If you’d like a glossy finish, heat the apricot jam or honey in a small saucepan over low heat until it becomes liquid. Brush the glaze over the top of the tart to add shine.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once chilled and set, slice the tart and serve it with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra touch.</li>
        </ol>
