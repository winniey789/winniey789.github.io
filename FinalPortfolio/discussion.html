        <div class="discussion-post post1">I've never heard of mail art before, so it was interesting to read about how Carrion defines it. Carrion also mentions something about  "knocking at a monster's door" when we post mail. I am curious to know what he means when he refers to it.

            mail art uses the act of mailing as a support; how do mailing objects or large packages considered mail art, if it does?  
            what differentiates mail art from regular mail?

        <div class="discussion-post post2"> It was interesting to read about the different metaphors representing a website and how the contents and functions of a website determine which wider category it falls into. It made me think about some current websites that I frequent, their designs, their purposes, and how they fit into these metaphors (room, shelf, plant, etc). And it was kind of a struggle. The internet is always changing at a rapid pace, and there is already so much that exists in today’s internet that it’s hard to categorize some websites.

            In the second half of the reading, Schwulst talks about a method of learning in which she takes a non-linear path. In other words, taking in multiple sources and materials simultaneously (even if it means veering off the intended subject) and making personal connections rather than accepting the connections that the author has already made. And I think I agree with that. It’s much more meaningful to synthesize information as opposed to summarizing it. 
            
            Questions: A lot of the types of websites that Schwulst has mentioned are ones that are informational or a space for creativity, so I was wondering where commercial websites fall in all of this?
            where else can we apply this synthesize-not-summarize method to?

        <div class="discussion-post post3">It seemed like Geocities was more than just a free web hosting service; it was a digital cultural phenomenon that shaped the early web. It offered countless users their first taste of personal web publishing and the freedom to broadcast their personalities, hobbies, and interests to the world. Although the platform became synonymous with amateur web design, I agree with Lialina that it left behind its unique digital footprint, but also a precursor to the social networks we know today. In a way, it’s almost like we’re able to time-travel back into the 1990s and see how the people of that time communicated and expressed. 

            Questions:How did Geocities shape our understanding of community and self-expression online?
            How does the aesthetics and culture of Geocities still influence digital design today?

        <div class="discussion-post post4">This reading discusses the complex relationship between digital and print media.  While digital media dominates in terms of information storage and networking capabilities, print retains a unique role in usability and tactile experience. Yet, both have developed not as opposing forces, but as intertwined formats that influence and adapt to each other. For example, it reminds me of how students use ipads/tablets like a notebook. While technically, we are taking digital notes, the physical motion of writing with an apple pencil makes it feel like we are taking notes with pencil and paper. Products like paper-textured screen protectors even mimic the tactile feel of real paper, highlighting how digital tools strive to recreate aspects of the print experience.

            Questions:How can digital publishing integrate more of the sensory aspects of print to create a more immersive reading experience?

        <div class="discussion-post post5">This reading highlights how alt-text is not just a functional tool but also a creative and interpretive process. The challenge lies in translating visual elements into concise and expressive language that conveys necessary information and aligns with the intent of the image. It is also interesting to see the role of artists in writing their own alt-text. While they have unique insight into their work, their descriptions might be biased toward intent rather than audience perception. This raises questions about who should be responsible for accessibility and how to make sure that the descriptions are both accurate and inclusive.

            Questions: 
            The reading describes alt-text as a form of translation. What are some challenges in "translating" visual elements into text? How might different people describe the same image in different ways?
            The reading highlights the poetic potential of alt-text. Is there a line between creative expression and accessibility?

        <div class="discussion-post post6">The paper discusses the gap between the idealized vision of computing and the realities of actual computer production, focusing on linguistic biases in software and programming languages. It also highlights how many typesetting systems are designed with Latin script assumptions, leading to systematic errors when rendering non-Latin scripts like Arabic. Similarly, programming languages are deeply rooted in English, from their syntax to their foundational keywords and identifiers. While it is modifiable, there are tall barriers to developing and adopting non-English programming languages.

            Question: How do the assumptions embedded in computing systems shape access and participation in technology, particularly for non-English-speaking users?

        <div class="discussion-post post7">The book offers an expansive exploration of the evolution of graphic design. As I was reading, I was particularly drawn to the concepts of Gestalt. It essentially says that people tend to perceive objects as whole forms, rather than just the sum of individual parts. It is a set of principles that describe how we organize visual elements into groups, patterns, and structures; something that’s super relevant for graphic designers when creating effective visuals and user experiences. And he highlights their direct application in graphic design. For example, designers use these principles to create a hierarchy in their layouts. By using proximity, similarity, and continuity, designers can lead the viewer’s eye through a design in a particular order. Designers also use these principles to create recognizable symbols that are simple yet memorable (i.e. FedEx arrow logo).
            Questions:
            How does the concept of Gestalt psychology influence modern design practices?
            Reinfurt suggests that graphic design is not just about aesthetics but is also influenced by culture, technology, and society. How do you think the role of graphic design has evolved in our digital age?

        <div class="discussion-post post8">Vera Frenkel’s String Games explores the concepts of presence and absence by combining the game Cat’s Cradle with video and telecommunication technology. While Cat’s Cradle is a game that traditionally requires physical interaction, Frenkel shifts this idea by connecting participants from two different cities: Toronto and Montreal. People were really impressed with how she used early teleconferencing technology, which was still in its experimental stages at the time, to create art. Although the tech was underdeveloped, Frenkel made it work in a way that felt ahead of its time. It was fascinating to see her take this new technology and incorporate it into a live, interactive performance, where participants passed an imaginary string between each other, creating an improvised exchange that showcased both the possibilities and limitations of the technology.
            Questions:
            - In String Games, Frenkel connects participants from two cities using early teleconferencing equipment. How does this use of technology alter our understanding of "connection" in a digital age?
            - In what ways did String Games predict key elements of new media art, such as interactivity, networked communication, and the blending of physical and digital spaces?

        <div class="discussion-post post9">In the talk, Soulellis discusses the changing landscape of publishing something. Traditionally, the act of posting meant nailing notices to a door post or printing on paper. Now, posting has evolved into algorithm-driven "feeds". Interestingly, in both physical and digital posts, the contents of the post and the intended audience must navigate through some sort of method to find each other and cause an interaction. The main difference is whether the information that's made public is fixed (literally to a post) or flowing (algorithms). Soulellis also argues that while traditional publishing focuses on attention-grabbing events, modern publishing increasingly manifests as a continuous flow of content that "feeds" the audience with minor events, which is controlled by an algorithm. 
            Questions: 
            - What do you think of the idea of publishing as an endless flow, as opposed to discrete, interruptive events? How does this shift affect our ability to process and engage with information?
            - How do you think the shift from traditional publishing to social media and live-streaming has changed the way we communicate?
            </div>
        <div class="discussion-post post10">I really enjoyed the way the story blends the digital world with the real world. We follow Gem as she navigates and begins to understand the stark differences between the two worlds. What really stood out to me was the way they presented the concepts of "The Way" and "The Beyond". "The Way" is presented as this cold and calculated structure of modern technology. It is data driven, and often disconnected from human feeling. On the flip side, we have "The Beyond", which's a space of memory, ancestral wisdom, and emotional intuition. It reminds us that technology isn’t just about its rigid code; it’s about people, community, and the stories we carry. On another note, the sporadic bolding of certain words reminds of Geronimo Stilton books (uses fun typefaces on certain words, often reflecting the meaning of the word). 
            Questions: 
            How do you think technology shapes the way we understand history, or forget it?
            How does "The Way" kind of represent the way we interact with technology in real life? It is accurate?

        <div class="discussion-post post11">Similar to previous readings, Boris Groys' "Art on the Internet" also discusses how the internet changes the fundamental ways of how we present things. And in this particular reading, it is the way we produce and consume art and literature. Unlike traditional cultural institutions like museums or publishing houses, which were more selective about what art was displayed or published, the internet is much less restrictive. And this shift has allowed artists to reach a broader audience with their works, but it also shifts how we define art itself. Historically, art and literature were seen as "fiction," which required audiences to immerse themselves in the material without acknowledging its institutional framing. But, on the internet, the framing is brought to the forefront. As a result, the work no longer operates in a fictional space but as part of a larger, interconnected reality.

            Questions: 
            Does the visibility of an artist’s personal life impact how the audience's view their work?
            How does the internet’s de-fictionalization of art affect creative expression?
