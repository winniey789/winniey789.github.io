        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project explores the act of transforming silence into language and action through a series of Risograph-printed posters. Using self-care as both subject and strategy, 
            the work frames personal prioritization as a form of resistance in the face of external expectations, pressures, and fear. 
            Rather than positioning self-care as passive or indulgent, the project asserts it as an active choice. 
            The posters feature hands as a recurring visual motif, representing forces that demand, restrain, or overwhelm. 
            Against these gestures of pressure, the act of turning inward—of choosing rest, care, and self-preservation—becomes a quiet but deliberate refusal. Through repetition, scale, and installation, the work engages multiplicity to amplify this message
